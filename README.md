# FCC Drum Machine

This is my answer for the project in the Front-End-Library course project in FCC

## Technology Used
1. CSS
1. React 

## Experience 
- understood how complicated state management in react would be on this project
- states and functions needs to be passed down from App component  until it reaches the component that uses it 

### Trials and tribulations
- Had a whole lot of fun making the volume control and made it affect when playing media clips
- Had a hard time making the whole theme as neon lights.
- Reading how props are passed down to the right component that needs it
- Understanding how foreach can be used to install functionalities by targeting by className

### Conclusion
- Had a blast in making things work out by logic
- Had a blast designing to a theme and sticking through with it until the end

### Things that didn't make it in the final product
- Most things that I want to implement has been implemented
- Tried to use bootsrap throughout the project but wasn't comfortable going through documentation and making classNames long
- I find raw scss/css to be more powerful than relying on bootstrap for the things that I want to use
- The only problem is with when a mobile user click it just show clicked not turned back to normal state
